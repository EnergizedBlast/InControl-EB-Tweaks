1.16-5.1.4:
- Fixed a crash with the new spawner when the player moves outside world boundaries

1.16-5.1.3:
- LostCity support is working again
- Made counting slightly safer in rare circumstances

1.16-5.1.2:
- Gamestage support is working again

1.16-5.1.1:
- Small bugfix

1.16-5.1.0:
- Big new spawner system (spawner.json) which implements a custom spawner with very little restrictions
- New 'incontrol' tag for spawn.json to allow to test for a mob spawned by this new system

1.16-5.0.4:
- Fixed a big bug with the 'block' test which could cause worlgen to hang in some situations

1.16-5.0.3:
- Fixed a bug causing mob condition with multiple mobs to fail (one mob was fine)

1.16-5.0.2:
- The 'biome' test would crash on biomes that were created using json
- New 'continue' flag for spawn rules. If this is true then when this rule fires it will not prevent processing for subsequent rules. This can be used (for example) to give armor to mobs under certain circumstances but still do other processing later

1.16-5.0.1:
- The mob counter now ignores the nodespawn flag. This should make it more compatible with modded mobs

5.0.0:
- Biome registry name is now preferred for biome checks
- 'tempcategory' is removed and replaced with a more generic 'category' for biomes. It's also a list now. The list of current categories is: taiga, extreme_hills, jungle, mesa, plains, savanna, icy, the_end, beach, forest, ocean, desert, river, swamp, mushroom and nether
- 'biometype' has changed. It now only works for the following values: desert, desert_legacy, warm, cool, and icy
- Numerical dimension ID's no longer work (like 0 for the overworld. Use 'minecraft:overworld' instead)

4.0.4:
- Fixed a bug with the health, damage, and speed actions. They often fired multiple times making the mobs too OP

4.0.3:
- 'perchunk' is implemented again
- Avoid server-side crashes in combination with debug command

4.0.2:
- Darkere improved performance when removing large amounts of mobs in potential spawn

4.0.1:
- Fixed a problem where the config files where generated in the root

3.9.16:
- Fixed a problem where 'onjoin' rules were also firing on the client which could cause issues with some of the conditions that don't properly work on the client

3.9.15:
- Worked around a problem caused in the previous version. The issue was that there was both a condition called 'helditem' as well as an action called 'helditem'. For spawns the condition has been renamed to 'playerhelditem'. It is recommended to use this in other places as well (when used as a condition)

3.9.14:
- Implemented a much requested feature with the spawn rules. That is support for gamestages. In Control will use the closest player (with a configurable maximum distance of 100). In addition keywords like helditem, helmet, trinker, ... are now also supported for spawn rules

3.9.13:
- Fixed a problem with the mincount/maxcount always using a hostile counter

3.9.12:
- Fixed a compatibility problem with old maxcount/mincount syntax

3.9.11:
- Fixed a problem that 'onJoin' rules would also affect entities like item drops and non-living entities
- Much more powerful 'mincount' and 'maxcount' syntax. The old syntax is still supported but you can now use a JSON object to specify one or more entities to count on, count entities for a given mod, and count scaled per player or per loaded chunk
- Fixed a problem with Minecraft mods being reported as 'forge' instead of 'minecraft'

3.9.10:
- Removed some debug code

3.9.9:
- Allow 'count' for itemstacks with 'give' and related commands
- Big optimisation in how 'maxcount' and 'mincount' are handled

3.9.8:
- If a spawn rule has no explicit result given (as opposed to result default, deny, or allow) then InControl will no longer set any result but just leave the result in the event as it already is
- Added new 'customname' action for spawn rules that you can use to set customnames on mobs when they spawn (turns out this is not possible to do with NBT)
- The 'mintime' and 'maxtime' tests will now correctly work beyond the first day

3.9.7:
- Various cleanups from SM9
- Subscribe to events with lowest priority to potentially catch more mods which have the same subscriber (from SM9)
- Fixed 'remove' in potential spawn. It was broken

3.9.6:
- Update to be compatible with Fx Control

3.9.5:
- Update to be compatible with Fx Control

3.9.4:
- Loot control will now also support the more advanced itemstack syntax for removal. Note that this is a potentially compatibility breaking change as specifying something like 'minecraft:stone_sword' (without meta) will now match all stone swords while before it would only match stone_sword with meta 0

3.9.3:
- Fixed a bug with the 'empty' keyword for items
- Postponed loading of the rule files so that blocks/items from other mods can be found better

3.9.2:
- New 'mod' attribute for 'block' test so that you can test for modded blocks: 'block': { 'mod': 'rftools' }
- New 'mod' attribute for 'helditem' (and similar) test so that you can test for modded blocks
- New 'empty' attribute for 'helditem' (and similar) tests so that you can test for an empty item: 'helditem': { 'empty': true }
- New 'count' attribute for 'helditem' (and similar) tests so that you can add expresssions to test for amounts. For example 'helditem': { 'item': 'minecraft:coal', 'count': '>=10' }
- New 'ore' attribute for 'helditem' (and similar) tests to do ore dictionary tests
- New 'energy' attribute for 'helditem' (and similar) tests to that you can test for forge energy in an item. This supports expressions
- New 'energy' attribute for 'block' test to that you can test for forge energy in a block. There is also a new 'energyside' attribute which allows you to specify from which side the energy will be examined. If not given it will use null

3.9.1:
- Much more powerful item description system with expressions on damage and nbt
- Giving items (armor, helditem, give command) is now also much more general and supports the new system
- Removed 'blockup' command and instead add a more general 'blockoffset' command that works together with the 'block' command
- Added support for EnigmaScript though 'state' and 'pstate' tests

3.9.0:
- Added support for Serene Seasons with new 'winter', 'summer', 'spring', and 'autumn' boolean keywords
- Added support for baubles: new 'amulet', 'ring', 'belt', 'trinket', 'charm', 'body', 'and 'head' keywords
- New 'blockup' test for various rules which will test the condition of the block above the current position
- New 'message' action to print a status message on screen for the nearest player (for 'spawn')

3.8.3:
- New 'offhanditem' and 'bothhandsitem' tags that are equivalent to 'helditem' but also work on the offhand (or both)

3.8.2:
- Updated to 2.0 API of GameStages. This means that InControl is no longer compatible with the older GameStages

3.8.1:
- Added a rule to check for spawns by mob spawners
